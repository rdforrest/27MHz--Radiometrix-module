  Date        rev,    who      what
  Dec 22      1.2     DF        Put in Servo software
  Jan 23      1.3     DF        Reduce baud rate to 300

   Arduino serial data default is, serial baud rate (9600) and 8 data bits, no parity,one stop bit,LSB and not inverted - the default

  Hardware connections#
  - For TX only, connect TX power at 9 volts to VIN on Arduino
  - For TX only, use pin D8 as ppm in from TX
  - For TX only, use pin D6 TX for the serial output to the Radiometrix module through a 120 k ohm resiator to protect input
  - For TX only, 5v sounder on pin D7
  - For TX only, Transmitter output voltage to VIN on Nano
  - For TX only, GND from Transmitter to GND on Nano
  - For RX only, Servo outputs pins D5 to D10
  - For RX only, Servo software serial output to pin D11

  For TX, Arduino pin D6 connected to 470 and 1k ohm resistors as voltage divider connected to ground. Module data input tapped off at 1k ohm resistor. For RX, Arduino pin D11 connected to module data output (open collector) with 4.7K ohm pullup to +5v.
