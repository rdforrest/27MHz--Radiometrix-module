# 27MHz--Radiometrix-module. Uses the LMT0 and LMR0 modules. Early development of this project. Still no correct data transferred over wireless but data is correctly transferred via hardwire. Core routines for conversion of PPM to digital alues at TX and RX PWM outputs to servos (6 channels) and Failsafes are in place and working but again only using a hardwire. RSSI works and is used to trigger an LED and the failsafe on the RX.
