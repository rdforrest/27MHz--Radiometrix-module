# 27MHz--Radiometrix-module.(LMT0 and LMR0 modules.) 
Oct 2025.
Rob Schuckman from the Netherlands has been doing some very good development work. Radiometrix modules are easily available and CE approved (They are not very cheap though!).
A lot of his development work has been in producing small and efficient antenna matching circuits. These make a big difference and are worth using for any 27MHz development,
You can see details of his extensive work on 27MHz r/c over here:
